                <p>With an understanding of our need for the electric future, North Bay Lighting was founded in San Rafael by Mr. Ed in 1980. Ed built NBL into a thriving business whilst serving Marin county. Today, his son Pete owns and operates NBL with Kalani and Vonte.
                <p>In addition to electrical products for commercial work, we serve a wide variety of specialty lighting bulbs and features.</p>

                    <p class="w3-text-grey">a solid-state lighting (SSL) device that fits in standard screw-in connections but uses LEDs (light-emitting diodes) to produce light. LED light bulbs are a more environmentally-friendly alternative to incandescent bulbs.</p><br>

                    <h5>Incandescent</h5>
                    <p class="w3-text-grey">an electric light with a wire filament heated until it glows.</p>
